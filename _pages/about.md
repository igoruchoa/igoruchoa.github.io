## I am a Ph.D. student in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department at the University of Maryland, College Park, in [Dr. Jacob Wenegratâ€™s group](https://wenegrat.github.io).__.


### My work is focused on air-sea interaction at submesoscale using observations and coupled model simulations. 


## My personal interests, I enjoy learning new languages, playing video games, and illustrating.
